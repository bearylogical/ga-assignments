# Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

## Problem Statement

The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. As an employee of the College Board 
the organization that administers the SAT - you are a part of a team that tracks statewide
participation and recommends where money is best spent to improve SAT participation rates.
Your presentation and report should be geared toward non-technical executives with the College Board 
and you will use the provided data and outside research to make recommendations about how the College Board 
might work to increase the participation rate in a state of your choice.
