It has been around 7 months since we [updated the theme on the redesign/new.reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/9oe9wh/feedback_on_the_redesign_style_changes_to_the/) and now we finally got round to updating the CSS theme on normal/old.reddit.

If you're on the desktop redesign you can view the theme through this link here: https://old.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/

###New subreddit CSS theme

Welcome to the new /r/malefashionadvice theme. 

It is a modified version of /r/Naut. 

It keeps the ethos of the old design of being minimal and hints of blue. We opted for Naut because it is one of the most popular and customizable themes used on reddit. 

According to our traffic stats around 9-11k people (well unique IPs technically) browse MFA on desktop on old.reddit. So this is for you guys mainly.

Improvements and features include:

* New(ish) banner
* New looking sidebar 
* More prominent Wiki tab
* Reddit Enhancement Suite compatible  
* Larger collapsable comment element: [see here](https://i.imgur.com/bKeY6Ub.png)
* New lick of paint all round

While we're here I'd like to give a warm thank you to /u/zmodem for being our main CSS helper and tweaker. Much banter was had with my poorly drawn MS Paint mockups and our (mis)communications. But we got there in the end.

###Feedback

We've been building, testing, and bug squashing for around a month or more in our internal testing sub. Hopefully it's smooth sailing, but if you find any bugs please comment below or send us a modmail and we'll get it fixed.

Plus if you have any general feedback please feel free to comment below. We'd love to hear what you have to say.

A year ago I was embarrassed at how many times I wore the same Under Armour polos (not that there's anything wrong with that!) and golf pants.  My wife is very fashion forward and always looks good so I decided to try and step up my fashion game.  I literally had no idea where to start or how to start.  I asked a buddy of mine what he used to get new clothes and he mentioned Stitch Fix.  After creating my account, filling out my style profile, and rating some outfits I was ready.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:  Stitch Fix helped me try out new styles.  A year ago I had no idea that pants could be straight fit, slim, athletic, etc.  I didn't even know slim fit shirts where a thing!  Thanks to their service I found out styles of shirts I liked, fits I liked, prints, materials, etc.  I feel like had I not had a box of clothes every few months with new items to try I definitely wouldn't have been as adventurous with my style.

I also like how generally responsive my stylist has been.  If there's something I need, as long as I leave a comment about it, they really hooked me up.  Through them I purchased my first blazer and it was a huge help with sizing, color, and how to wear it.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:  PRICE...I know the saying, ""buy nice or buy twice"" but sometimes the cost of the items they'd send me was really outside of my price range.  They also make it tough to buy only the items you like.  If I only like a few items it could bump my overall cost up by $50!

In house brands.  Of course, Stitch Fix is going to offer brands that they are representing, nothing wrong with that, but I felt like as my year went on I was only getting their brands regardless of what I told my stylist.  While this has been an issue it really only happened the last two boxes or so.

&amp;#x200B;

In Summary:  I am dropping Stitch Fix because it has served it's purpose.  I have learned so much about style, clothing, and what I like and don't like in the last year that I look like a different guy.  Stitch Fix and this Sub Reddit have been the two biggest helps in that regard.  I would say if you are like I was and in need of some help styling, then try Stitch Fix.  It can be very helpful in finding what you like and don't like.  However, if you have a good grasp of what you like and what your style is then I would stay away from the service.  It probably is a waste of your time.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Info:  I&amp;#39;m a 34 year old elementary teacher.

This is one of my first posts, so please forgive any errors/omissions I'm making here.

I just graduated high school, and am going to college this fall. Over the past few years, I've taken care of a lot of basic, easy items like tshirts, jeans, etc. Now that I'm older, I'm looking to add some more ""advanced"" items to my wardrobe, and ideally these will also help me out with my height (5'6-5'7) and appear closer to my age.

Having read the wiki/sidebar, I've gained some new understanding, but before I can act on that, I need to know where to shop. On YouTube and other sources, I've seen the theory that long-term/foundational items such as leather jackets, boots, etc., should be bought at a higher quality point with the expectation of long lifetime use.

That makes sense to me, but without quite as much money and more importantly, clothing experience, I wasn't sure if it would be a better idea to purchase a cheaper ""disposable"" item. Over time, I could decide how I feel about different items and whether or not I wish to invest in an upgrade for each piece.

So, in summary: when moving beyond ""basic bastard"" items, is it better to first invest in quality or sample with lower quality pieces?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello MFA, &lt;/p&gt;

I am recently married and will be honeymooning with my wife in Greece in late August. I'm looking for a little help on how to pull off the smart casual look while in Greece. 


To start off I'm from Seattle and I'm a bigger guy, about 6ft 1in, and about 275lb. My usual style is sort of a workwear Americana with fannel, jeans, iron rangers. In summer I'm a shorts and tshirts guy. 


So in late August my wife and I will be doing 2 weeks in Santorini, Mykonos, Naxos and Paros. We will be doing some hiking exploring, but mostly just tourist and beach stuff. We aren't going to be packing very heavy so I was wondering if I could get some help with what to wear and what to bring while keeping it sort of minimalist. 

I have some dark jeans, and some chinos that I like. I also have some Prana hiking shorts and regular chino shorts I was thinking of wearing. 

For shirts I'm kinda at a loss all I really have is T-shirts for hot weather. I recently bought a button down short sleeve (flamingo print lol) from Bonobos that my wife loves on me. I was thinking about buying more of these but in other prints that aren't quite so hiwaiian. I thought these shirts would be a good fit for greece because they breath well. If anyone has any advice on brands that are big man friendly and will still make me look sharp, that would be great. Just for reference I am a XXL reg. Fit in the Bonobos button up. I find that I am just a bit to big for a lot of brands, so if any stylish big bois want to name me some brands that would be super.

I'd kinda like a linen button up as well but have no clue where to even start with that. 


For shoes I was looking at wearing Killshots and sandals for a lot of the trip, but I'm open to anything.


Literally any advise on what to pack or buy would be great, I'm not very good at this and I just want to look pretty for my wife.

I haven't been really active in this subreddit for a while now, but I feel like this subreddit might have the most impact on what I have to say and have the best discussion going on the topic.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the topic you may ask? Shoes. More specifically men's leather shoes.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I've started coming here asking for advice, people have always recommended Allen Edmonds (AE) as a good baseline on what good shoes should be; goodyear welted, quality leather, etc. And I have always aspired to owning a pair of AEs. Being a broke college student at the time, it seemed so far away. I was thinking I'd have to be an engineer before I even thought about getting a pair of $400 AEs. A while later, I learned how low in price they could go when on sale. Still, $100+ is still a lot for a pair of shoes. However, through deals, I started to grow my collection. I started with a pair of beautiful \[Andrew Lock monk straps\]([https://imgur.com/a/nJ8DM](https://imgur.com/a/nJ8DM)), then I got a pair of Chippewa boots, then some Timberland bluchers, eventually I got my AEs, then another pair of AEs, and more, some Rider Boots Co derbies, and the list goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently realized that, though I love the styles, I mainly got a lot of these because people were raving about how good they were. Their nice construction, good leather, etc. All this has been engrained in me. I even went further by using my leathercrafting knowledge to nitpick even more on the leather type and quality. Looking at my collection now, I see that it's a decent size. I have everything I need for most occasions. I've followed what everyone says about what good leather footwear should be, but I've come to realize I don't even wear a fraction of my collection. Why? *Because they're not comfortable!*

&amp;#x200B;

...

&amp;#x200B;

Ok. Maybe it's more like *it's not as comfortable* as some shoes. I've noticed that I don't wear a lot of my shoes because the break in is such a pain (literally). Why waste effort and be miserable when there are actually shoes that come out of the box comfortable? I've noticed for the last year, I've basically been wearing my black Bruno Magli derbies, my Jack Erwin oxfords, and my Clarks chukkas. Based on what this community deems as quality footwear, these are on the lower end of the list (blake stitch and cement construction) and they've lasted me \*years\* without any real signs of wear or failure.

&amp;#x200B;

I like them, they look good, they're comfortable, and so far they've lasted.. And these are probably shoes that rarely every get recommended because they don't check off every item on what ""good leather footwear"" is.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if my attempt on advice has turned into a rant, but please let me know on what you think on the topic. I believe it's still good to ask what's in style, but saying people should only look at brands xyz and everything else is trash is the wrong way to give advice.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been a part of the male fashion community now for about 5-6 years now.

I believe it&amp;#39;s still good to ask what&amp;#39;s in style, but saying people should only look at brands xyz and everything else is trash is the wrong way to give advice.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m a long time lurker is this sub but this is my first time posting here.  Gotten lots of good advice from the community and figured tHis would be a good place for some advice/discussion. 

First off, a little about myself.  I am 6’5” 205lbs and turning 40 in a few short weeks.  In my quest to “dress my age” I have recently decided to revamp my entire wardrobe. I’ve bought a lot of chinos &amp; denim from Banana Republic and simplified my shirts with a few polos, button ups and v-necks. I gave almost everything I had to goodwill and just decided to almost completely start over... with the exception of my shoes. 

Growing up my parents couldn’t afford to buy me the shoes that I really wanted so once I was older and in a position where I could afford them, I bought them. I currently have somewhere around 70 pairs of sneakers, consisting mostly of Jordan’s, air max 1’s, Air Force 1’s and Yeezy’s.  At this point my shoe collection is absolutely not something I am willing to part with. 

So that leads me to my question.  Is it possible to dress more “age appropriate” while still proudly wearing my sneaker collection and not looking like a clown in the process?

EDIT:  I just want to say thank you to everyone for your input.  I probably should have mentioned from the start that my job pretty much allows me to wear whatever I want. I do work in an office but I work in the construction/home improvement industry. I have very, very minimal face to face contact with customers and most of the communication I have with them is via phone/email.  I also have full sleeve tattoos on both arms, including my hands. 

I’m good with mixing &amp; matching colors, and I also know better than to wear something bright and crazy during inappropriate scenarios. (Not going to wear a pair of Shattered Backboard AJ1’s to an important meeting with the boss and some vendors)

On the topic of watches, I currently own a couple (Nixon, Diesel and Guess).  After listening to some advice and doing a little research of my own... and listening to the current state of my bank account I’ve decided to purchase an Orient Bambino. I really, really like a lot of the Hamilton pieces but think I need to save up a bit before I take the plunge on those.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!

I’ve bought a lot of chinos &amp;amp; denim from Banana Republic and simplified my shirts with a few polos, button ups and v-necks. I gave almost everything I had to goodwill and just decided to almost completely start over... with the exception of my shoes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up my parents couldn’t afford to buy me the shoes that I really wanted so once I was older and in a position where I could afford them, I bought them. I currently have somewhere around 70 pairs of sneakers, consisting mostly of Jordan’s, air max 1’s, Air Force 1’s and Yeezy’s.  At this point my shoe collection is absolutely not something I am willing to part with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that leads me to my question.  Is it possible to dress more “age appropriate” while still proudly wearing my sneaker collection and not looking like a clown in the process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  I just want to say thank you to everyone for your input.  I probably should have mentioned from the start that my job pretty much allows me to wear whatever I want. I do work in an office but I work in the construction/home improvement industry. I have very, very minimal face to face contact with customers and most of the communication I have with them is via phone/email.  I also have full sleeve tattoos on both arms, including my hands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m good with mixing &amp;amp; matching colors, and I also know better than to wear something bright and crazy during inappropriate scenarios. (Not going to wear a pair of Shattered Backboard AJ1’s to an important meeting with the boss and some vendors)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of watches, I currently own a couple (Nixon, Diesel and Guess).  After listening to some advice and doing a little research of my own... and listening to the current state of my bank account I’ve decided to purchase an Orient Bambino. I really, really like a lot of the Hamilton pieces but think I need to save up a bit before I take the plunge on those.&lt;/p&gt;

* Chest is tight. Increase from 18 to 20 or 22.
* Collar feels loose. I plan to wear this casual with the top button always undone. Decrease from 15.5 to ?
   * Wish I had chosen ""Colorado button down"" collar instead - this one feels a bit large. Unfortunately I don't think this can be changed.
* Sleeve width feels snug. Increase from 6.5 to 8
* My arm movement feels restricted with my arms out front. Not sure which changes will fix this. Thoughts:
   * Maybe shorten the yoke?
   * Will this already be fixed by increasing the chest?
   * Maybe Change the should/armpit fit from ""tailored"" to ""full""

&lt;p&gt;Do you guys have any ideas for some more feminine bits of clothing or ideas for outfits. I&amp;#39;ve been really attracted to this idea for a long time and I would love to dive into it.&lt;/p&gt;
