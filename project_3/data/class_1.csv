This subreddit has grown *so much* over the past few years, and we wanted to make a new post to go over some of the posting guidelines that help us accommodate all the different kinds of users we get here.

************************************************************
You want to post about *female fashion*?  Perfect!  We welcome everyone with an interest in clothing broadly coded as feminine, people who identify somewhere towards feminine who explore gender-neutral style, and everyone in between!  FFA is a great place to discuss fashion, give &amp; request advice, share inspiration, and more.  All are welcome!  **Because of our subreddit’s size, though, we ask that you consider the following before making a post:**

##IS YOUR POST SPAM?

For the purposes of this subreddit, spam is anything that we deem to be made purely with the intent to generate traffic to another website or abuse FFA’s structure to promote a website or a blog. Our spam policy is zero-tolerance - spammers will be banned immediately.  Details on this can be found in our [FFA Rules]( https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/rules#wiki_on_brand_participation_in_ffa).


##IS YOUR POST MEANT TO GENERATE DISCUSSION?

If you are submitting a link to a fashion-related media item, you should include discussion prompts to engage the FFA community.  If you have a fun discussion prompt that you think FFA would be into, add questions.  A discussion item that is submitted with no efforts toward engaging users (or text that only says, “thoughts?” without elaborating) is typically considered to be a [Random Fashion Thought](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=random+fashion+thoughts&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).  If you want to ask the community about a general topic while also contributing personal details, consider omitting the details from the post and instead adding the personalized bits as a comment.  For example, if you want to know what pants FFAers are wearing this summer, don’t include “I’m looking for ankle-length linen blend pants in a light camel color, with button-secured pockets on the front and a raw hem, size 34” in the body of your post.  We think that is a request for personalized advice, and your post will be redirected to [Daily Questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=daily+questions&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).  So… 

## DOES YOUR POST REQUEST PERSONALIZED ADVICE?

In an effort to keep our front page centered on larger fashion-related discussions, requests for personalized advice should generally go to one of our weekly threads.  While we always have new people looking for specific advice, we also have old-timers who have seen similar material over and over.  This is the beauty of FFA!  Newcomers can dive into the fashion world, and FFA regulars can offer advice and more in-depth discussions.  Daily Questions and other scheduled threads keep our front page free of hyper-specific fashion advice.  These threads tend to be heavily trafficked, but if you find that your comments aren’t getting answered in one DQ thread, feel free to repost on another day!  Check out our posting schedule to see where your post belongs:

##HAS YOUR  TOPIC BEEN COVERED ON FFA RECENTLY?

We’ve historically had some really great discussions on ethical fashion, wardrobe changes across seasons, KonMari, and big fashion events (just to name a few topics).  We love these posts, we just don’t want to have the same discussions over and over again every day.  Please use the Reddit search function or search Google using [‘site:reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice’](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Ffemalefashionadvice+YOUR+SEARCH+HERE).  Try using different words; if you’re looking for a post on ethical brands, for example, be sure to try “green,” “eco,” “ethical,” “ethics,” etc.  Also check out the sidebar, where we’ve compiled a ton of resources, including a [“Guide to Not Freezing to Death”](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/3sf5f8/the_beginners_guide_to_not_freezing_to_death/), [“What to Wear to a Wedding That’s Not Your Own”](https://redd.it/252xvs), [“A Primer on Materials”](http://redd.it/1khr5r), and much, *much*, more.  The [FFA Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/index) also has a wealth of info that has been gathered since FFA’s inception in December 2010.  You may find exactly what you’re looking for.

If we haven’t had a relevant post in a while, please post one - but if your post is similar to a post we just had, your post may be removed.  We’re just trying to keep it fresh.

##DID YOUR POST GET REMOVED?

**There are a number of reasons why posts are removed, and there’s a number of routes removal can take:**

* Automod automatically flags posts/comments containing content that looks like spam or general nastiness (*but note that she also can be overeager*).  Sometimes she will flag new accounts, so if you’re new to Reddit, your first few comments here might not be visible immediately.  Posts flagged by Automod require manual approval and are added to the moderation queue to be viewed by a human moderator.  While we try to get to the queue regularly, we are sometimes asleep and cannot readily approve posts.  If you believe your post has been stuck in a queue for an especially long time, feel free to message us.  The queue is a chaotic place, and unfortunately the occasional post can get lost in the mess.

* We human moderators also remove posts.  Most often we remove posts that belong in a scheduled thread or break [our Rules]( https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/rules); however, we also remove posts that have not gone well in the past.  These include posts like, “What styles do you hate?” and “What looks ugly on your body?” Each time these posts have been approved, the comments are at best unproductive and at worst hurtful toward our community.   While we welcome constructive criticism and debates, our vibe is generally positive, and we don’t want to open discussions that encourage only mass negativity.  [Don’t yuck someone else’s yum](http://cf.broadsheet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/morecards412.jpg).

* Posts that have received several user reports are auto-removed and added to the moderation queue.  FFAers (just like you!) report posts to assist us in catching rule-breaking or repetitive content, and reapproval requires manual review.  Once a reported post is reviewed by a moderator, your post will either be reinstated or you will be given a reason for removal.  

##IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS:

[Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffemalefashionadvice)!  Note that messages sent only to FFA_Moderator are inconsistently ^(or never) read, so use that link to contact all of us at once.

**Sellers:**

* Only regular members of [/r/femalefashionadvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice) may list items to sell. If you are unsure if you qualify, please message the mod team.
* You must include photos of the actual item you are intending to sell, not just product photos.
* You must host the photos of your items on imgur.
* You may not link to ebay, craigslist, etsy, or any other online retail site.
* Please edit your post with the status of items as they are sold.
* Please include where you are shipping from and where you are willing to ship to.
* Final purchase details are to be discussed over PM and not in the thread itself.
* The mod team at FFA is not responsible for sales that go wrong. You are selling items at your own risk. Please do due diligence before completing a transaction. Be aware that Paypal almost always sides with the buyer when transactions go wrong.

**Buyers:**

* Buying items is open to anyone
* Feel free to ask questions about items as others may have the same questions as you.

With modern clothes I find that my body type (petite with an hourglass shape) just doesn&amp;#39;t fit right - the blouses are too tight or too loose, the fits push skin and fat into unsightly shapes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

In the show, which takes place in current times, she is ageless, retaining the look of her 30-something year old self despite being about 100 years old at this point.

Her fashion aesthetic is vintage, but I feel her outfits have a slightly modern take on everything. I'm so in love with all her striped sweaters, pencil skirts, and pixie pants. I want to own everything she wears.

It's been a while since I've gone clothes shopping IRL. I have finally accepted that ordering pants off of the internet is too much of a gamble, which sucks because trying on pants is very hard on me. I'm a rectangle leaning into slim pear shape and I HATE it. I'm a cis-woman but I have a lot of issues with seeing very visible curves or anything very feminine on me. I just don't feel comfortable with myself when I feel like I look super womanly. Idk why that is, but that's why it's a mental thing, isn't it? Anyway I made the mistake of trying on a bodycon dress and boy, that sent me spiraling. 

I have a lot of styles I avoid because I know it'll trigger my obsessions. I stick to A-lines, shift dresses, loose tops, and high waists as I feel those diminish the look of my hips. No wide leg pants, no skinny jeans, no bodycons (lol). 

But then I started to get anxious like...am I using those styles as a crutch? My husband told me to do what makes me feel comfortable and happy, but I also have GAD and oftentimes what makes me feel comfortable is unhealthy for me (ie: cancelling plans, rejecting opportunities). Would it be better for me to force myself to wear these clothes (almost as like exposure therapy), or would that make it worse? I'm not really fond of bodycon dresses or skinny jeans, and I genuinely like the styles I do wear, so it's not like I'm keeping myself from wearing something I love, I'm more like ""would it help me normalize my hips in my mind if I wore them?""

&amp;#x200B;

Mods, please delete if this isn't allowed and I apologize. I'd love to get a thread going about designer ""dupes."" I don't mean designers or manufacturers that shamelessly copy from other designers and sell it as their own, but brands or specific items that captures the overall ""aesthetic"" or vibe of another more expensive brand for less. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I love Reformation and Realisation Par and have ordered from both many times. I have a hard time finding anything with the same quality construction or attention to detail as these two brands (ie. I know I can get a floral mini dress off Asos, but it's not going to be silk or sturdy linen, the back zipper won't lay as flat, etc). I'm about to bite the bullet on a dress from Eggie who is also based out of LA, but I'm unfamiliar with the company and a bit nervous. I would love to find other brands that do feminine, slightly sexy summer dresses with good construction that fit TTS (and of course it's a bonus if it's a little more budget friendly).

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any other brands or online boutiques that you have been impressed with? Are there any specific items dupes that you have been impressed with more than the original?
